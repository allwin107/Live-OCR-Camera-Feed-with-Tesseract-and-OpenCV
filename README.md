# Live-OCR-Camera-Feed-with-Tesseract-and-OpenCV
This project utilizes Tesseract and OpenCV to capture live video from a camera, perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the captured frames, and display the extracted text in real-time. The extracted text is also saved to a text file for further use.
